Unit Test for the Map Module:

The map module of our app has one input parameter, the desired location.  This parameter is chosen from a list of pre-determined 
locations which we copied letter for letter from the maps.ucsc.edu page.  When the user clicks on a location, the location is added 
to the base url of maps.ucsc.edu and returns a google map with a pin on the desired location.
